How do you see UI, the main UI, of the editor? I want to have horizontal scrollable tape with frames
of GIF at bottom, frames should be checkable with check box, so user will be able to delete some frames
from the GIF. And resized to fit available space current frame in the center of main window. Frames
should be clickable, so user can select any frame. And for first Alpha version of the application
I want to implement crop function. Crop will be accessible from tool bar, and in this mode user
should be able to draw rectangle to crop to, and on pressing Enter crop should do the job for all
frames.

That's all. Sounds not so complicated, let's do it. And let's start from creating a widget
that will represent a frame in the tape of frames.
