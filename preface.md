# Preface

I guess that you, reader, know C\+\+, know what is object-oriented programming
and design. In this book you won't find answers on basics of C\+\+, but you
can find some practices, useful practices when developing with Qt. I guess
that you understand basics of Qt. This book is an explanation of development
processes of the real GUI projects, written on C\+\+/Qt. You won't find
explanations of public Qt API, as I guess that Qt API is very well
described in Qt help.

Projects, described in this book are not so big and it's very good start point
to look at working code, as developer should read the code of another developers,
this will improve your Qt skills. These projects are Open Source and you can
become a part of these projects, you are welcome to make pull requests on GitHub
with improvements.

The goal of this book is to introduce the reader with Qt Widgets, the best
UI framework, on my opinion, for developing cross-platform, effective desktop
applications on the real examples. You can look at the chapters of this book as on
tutorials.
