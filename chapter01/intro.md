# Introduction

I want to show on the real example how to create simple GIF editor with Qt widgets.
Why Qt widgets and not QML? The answer is simple - I want to create a desktop application, and on my opinion for desktop
applications it's better to use widgets. Full sources of this example you can find here

As backend of image processing I will use Magick++ from ImageMagick.
